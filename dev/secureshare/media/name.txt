R: How are you doing fantasy?

A: Um, I'm starting a league...starting a fantasy football league actually with my buddies from back home. I wanna do like a "keeper league," cause it like, keeps everyone in it longer-

R: Is it for cash?

A: Like, every year we try and do it for cash, but, like, everyone back out. It's kinda annoying. So, by like the fifth week in the season everyone whose team sucks like stops following it so it's not fun. So, I proposed that we did cash, and did a keeper league so you draft players that you keep year to year. Not a full keeper league, but maybe just like you keep two players.

R: Yeah yeah yeah. You get to keep like your first two picks.

A: Or you can just at the end of the year-

R: Whoever, yeah.

A: -protect two picks from going back into the pool.

R: That's kinda sick.

A: Yeah, but my buddies said they'd rather just do a regular one, so I'm like "Alright, let's have another underwhelming fantasy football season again."

*Laughing*

A: I'll have to do some, um, some daily fantasy.

R: Yeah I'm thinking about it. I'm gonna do, I'm probably-

A: Even though it makes me completely unproductive for my entire Sunday.

R: I'll probably do like Draft Kings or something. Yeah actually that's a really good point.
